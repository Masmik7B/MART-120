# MART-120 Homework 1
Graphical user interface and command line interface are two ways to interact with computers. Graphical user interface is much more commonly used
and relies on more visual components in its operation. For example, visual icons like folders, icons, and other interactive elements are seen while
using GUIs. On the other hand command line interface is text based, and is often used by more advanced users. This relies on text commands being
entered into a terminal. While GUIs are more user freindly, CLIs are more powerful and can perform more complex tasks faster. If a user wanted to
create a new folder, using GUI they would click on the icon, hit new, and then create the folder. Using CLI a user would type in a command for a
folder and then execute that command. Both GUI and CLI have their advantages, as both are very useful.
