I found the "Last Lecture" video to be very impactful. I feel like sometimes I look at my dreams and find them to be unrealistic, yet Randy
Pausch was months away from dying due to a life threatening illness and still looked forward to his dreams. Instead of being pessimistic about the
situation, he delivered his speech with a lot of energy and enthusiasm, focusing on living instead of dying. I found this to be very powerful, and
loved this quote especially, "We cannot change the cards we are dealt, just how we play the hand." To me, this perfectly sums up his message and
is a mindset I strive to have in the future. I am blessed to have a decent hand in life, so I might as well not waste it just because I might have 
a negative mindset. Another part of his talk that I found to be impactful was his attitude when faced with rejection. Randy's dream was to become
a Disney Imagineer, and when he was faced with rejection multiple times, he didn't give up. This is something that I really strive for in life,
as personally rejection is one of my biggest fears. My dream has always been to make music and put it out there for people to enjoy, yet despite 
dedicating a lot of time to playing guitar, I haven't played in any bands, and many people don't even know that I can play. This is something that
has continuously bothered me, yet I haven't done anything about it, mostly from fear of not being good enough for other people. This video has
inspired me to take steps in getting over rejection, and appreciating the things that I have going for me, instead of dwelling on the what ifs
and setbacks in life.
