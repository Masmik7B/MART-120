I think that learning styles definitely affect how we learn things. For example, when I took my learning style quiz my results came back as mainly 
auditory learning. I think that this is accurate because I've noticed that I feel more comfortable understanding instructions when I am verbally 
told how to do things. However, in my results auditory scored at 45% and visual scored 40%. This clearly shows that both styles can be impactful, 
and in my case, it depends on what I'm learning. A good example of this is how I learn to play guitar, which heavily involves hearing if what I'm
playing is correct, but also visualizing what to do with my hands. For others I know that some people heavily favor one learning style over some
others. That being said, sometimes the favored learning style isn't always the most effective way to learn, depending on what is being taught or 
absorbed. While abosrbing information using a preferred learning style may boost engagement and motivation, I think that mixing learning styles is
probably the best way to learn overall. With this in mind, I think that teachers should be open to implementing elements of every learning style.
This would not only reduce the chance of people with opposing learning styles struggling in class, but it would also boost engagement and give
everyone a chance to effectively understand lessons.
